# 🌿 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection (CNN + KNN Hybrid Model)

This project detects diseases in tomato leaves using a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification.  
The work was presented at the **IC-AMSI-2024 International Conference**.

## 🚀 Overview
Tomato crops suffer from multiple bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Early detection helps prevent losses.  
This project uses:
- CNN for deep feature extraction  
- KNN for lightweight classification  
- PlantVillage dataset  
- Jupyter Notebooks & Python scripts  
- Research-backed methodology

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### **1️⃣ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
Extracts high-level image features such as:
- Texture  
- Lesion patterns  
- Color distortions  

### **2️⃣ KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
Uses CNN features for classification:
- Fast inference  
- Low complexity  
- Interpretable results
